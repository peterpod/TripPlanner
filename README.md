This is a website I created for a brief class assignment.
The webpage is called TripPlanner with a trip based theme.
It utilized some javascript and jquery functionality to add 
some user interaction and basic javascript features.

TripPlanner utilizes the flickr API to display pictures 
of a certain locations you input into the form (ex: USA, Saint Louis) 
via an ajax request to their API. The app can make 
multiple requests to the API by adding destination.

Future improvements to the site will include mapping functionality
by using an API such as google maps and visualizing a route for
users.
